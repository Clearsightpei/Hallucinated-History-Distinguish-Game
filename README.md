While the game focuses on history, it can also be used in creative, social ways—like friends quizzing each other or exploring how AI might misrepresent them. I designed it to be adaptable for different subjects and teaching styles.If you have any feedback or suggestions for improving the site or its features, I’d be very grateful to hear them.
Why I Made It:
AI tools are increasingly used to explain or summarize history, but they can hallucinate sources or twisting events, especially when information is censored or limited. This can be harmful, spreading believable but false narratives. Even well-documented events can lose credibility if AI-generated misinformation spreads widely.
