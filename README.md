Key Features:

Each historical event includes a brief intro, one real version, and one hallucinated version created using LLMs.


Users can write and organize stories into folders by topic.


Tracks individual accuracy ("Show My Stats") and overall question performance ("Show Overall Stats").


Designed for quick access in classrooms and group settings.


Flexible format: stories can be historical events, quiz questions, or even personal comparisons—like a real self-description vs. an AI-generated version. This adds a fun, social element where friends can test how well they know each other.


Raises awareness about how AI may unintentionally distort history.

Why I Made This Game


As AI tools become more common, they’re being used to explain, summarize, or even teach history. But large language models like ChatGPT can “hallucinate”—meaning they sometimes make things up that sound real. This might be okay in creative writing, but it can be very harmful when it comes to historical facts. AI might invent fake sources, twist real events, or leave out important moments, especially when data is missing or censored.

For example, in China, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests are heavily censored. If an AI is trained mostly on Chinese internet sources, it might wrongly conclude that the event never happened, or worse, create fake “evidence” of something else entirely. That’s a rewriting of history.

Another problem is that the histories of underrepresented groups are often not well documented. If the AI doesn’t have enough information, it may try to “fill in the blanks” with made-up stories. This can spread false ideas that feel believable, making it even harder to find the truth.

Even when a historical event is well documented, AI can still cause harm by generating so many fake versions that people start to question what's actually real. If false accounts are widely shared, even accurate records can begin to lose credibility. The truth becomes buried under a pile of confident-sounding misinformation, and it becomes easier for bad actors to deny or distort real events by pointing to AI-generated confusion.


My goal is to help students experience this problem themselves—by reading two versions of a historical event and having to guess which one is real. It’s a way to build critical thinking skills, and to show how important it is to protect real, evidence-based history.
