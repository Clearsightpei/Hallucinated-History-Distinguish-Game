Key Features


Teachers (or students) can create folders with custom content
A folder contains multiple stories, and each story includes:


A title


Brief introduction


Real version 


Hallucinated version 


Explanation of why the real one is correct (optional)


No login is required


Users can track their own accuracy (“Show My Stats”) and see how others did on each question (“Show Overall Stats”).


While the game focuses on history, it can also be used in creative, social ways—like friends quizzing each other or exploring how AI might misrepresent them. I designed it to be adaptable for different subjects and teaching styles.


Why I Made It:


AI tools are increasingly used to explain or summarize history, but they can hallucinate sources or twisting events, especially when information is censored or limited. This can be harmful, spreading believable but false narratives. Even well-documented events can lose credibility if AI-generated misinformation spreads widely.
